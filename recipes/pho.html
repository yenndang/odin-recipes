        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            It’s hard to beat the flavor of a beef-based pho broth, however. But alas, 
            it can take at least 6 hours to make, or much longer if you simmer the broth
             overnight as some Vietnamese families do!
        </p>
        <p>
            This Instant Pot pho has the satisfying flavor a long-simmered broth, 
            but it can be made in less than half the time of pho broth simmered traditionally on the stove.

            <li>
                Thinly sliced onion

            </li>
            <li>
                Lime wedges
            </li>
            <li>
                Cooked beef balls <em>(thinly sliced eye round, optional)</em>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Start by <strong>charring your ginger and onions</strong>. Use tongs to hold
                 the ginger and onions over an open flame, or place directly 
                 on an electric burner. Turn until they’re lightly blackened 
                 and fragrant about 3 minutes. Rinse away the blackened skins
                  and set aside.
            </li>
            <li>
                Place the <strong>bones and beef chuck in large stockpot and add water 
                to cover</strong>. Bring to a boil and <strong>boil for 5 minutes</strong>. 
                Drain in a colander and rinse. This process will give you a much cleaner broth.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Set aside your beef chuck in the refrigerator for use later. 
                Transfer the bones to your Instant Pot</strong>, along with the charred/cleaned
                 ginger and onions. Add the scallions, fish sauce, sugar, and salt.
            </li>
            <li>
                Now <strong> toast the spices (star anise, cloves, cinnamon stick, black 
                cardamom, fennel seeds, and coriander seeds)</strong> in a dry pan over medium 
                low heat for about 3 minutes, until fragrant. Use kitchen string to <strong>tie
                 up the spices in a piece of cheesecloth</strong>, and add it to the pot. Cover 
                 everything with 3 ½ quarts of water.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Seal the Instant Pot and place on the manual high pressure setting 
                for 120 minutes.</strong> Allow the pressure to release naturally (15-30 minutes).
                 Add the beef chuck and put back on the meat/stew setting for 30 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Use the Quick Pressure Release, and when the Instant Pot is once again 
                safe to open, <strong> skim the broth for excess fat and impurities</strong>. Adjust 
                seasoning by adding more salt, sugar, and/or fish sauce to taste.
            </li>
            <li>
                To serve, <strong>boil the noodles according to package instructions. </strong>
                Add to a bowl. Place some slices/shreds of the beef chuck on the noodles.
                 Cover with broth, and garnish with sliced onion, bean sprouts, and 
                 Thai basil, and be sure to squeeze some fresh lime juice over the top! You can also add some cooked beef balls or thinly sliced eye round if you like.
