        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            Crème Brûlée is a delicious baked custard that is topped off with 
            caramelized sugar and served with fresh whipped cream and berries 
            for the most amazing dessert of all time.</p>
        <p>
            Crème brûlée translates from French to English as, “burnt cream.” 
             It’s funny because the cream isn’t really burnt, however, the sugar 
             that goes on top off the dessert is caramelized for a slightly 
             charred caramel taste.  The combination of crispy sugar and soft
              custard cream makes for an incredible flavor and texture contrast.
            Don’t let the word crème brûlée scare you because they are one of
            the simpler traditional French dessert recipes to make using only 
            4 ingredients.

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 vanilla beans</li>
            <li>1 quart heavy whipping cream</li>
            <li>12 egg yolks</li>
            <li>1 cup sugar + 6 teaspoons</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Cut the fresh vanilla beans</strong> in half longways and scrape out all 
                of the vanilla bean seeds from the inside.  Transfer to a medium-size
                sauce pot.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Add heavy whipping cream</strong> to the pot with the vanilla beans and 
                cook over low heat to scald.</li>
            <li>
                <strong>Separate egg yolks</strong> from egg whites.  Set aside egg whites for 
                some other use as it will not be used in this recipe.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Whisk the egg yolks with sugar</strong> in a bowl and set aside.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Once the cream has scalded</strong> pour a small amount of it into
                the bowl with the sugar and eggs to temper, and gently whisk it together. 
                Then, add the rest of the cream and gently whisk.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Strain the mixture through</strong> a fine-mesh strainer or 
                chinois into a large pourable container.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Place the ramekins onto a sheet tray or a cake tray pan.</strong> 
                Pour the crème brûlée mixture evenly between the ramekins filling them to
                 almost the top.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Transfer the tray to the oven</strong>  and place it on the rack.  
                Fill the tray with warm water until it reaches the ½ waypoint on the ramekins.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Bake at 325° for 35 to 40 minutes </strong>or until they are 
                firm in the center when you tap them.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Remove from the water bath and cool at room temperature for 30
                minutes</strong>before completely cooling in the refrigerator for 60-90 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Add 1 tablespoon of sugar to the top </strong> of each crème brûlée 
                and move the sugar around by rocking the ramekin in your hand.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Using a torch, caramelize the sugar on top</strong>
                 until it is crispy and lightly browned.
            </li>
        </ol>
